# 6 OOP Concepts in Java with examples

Java is a class-based object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is built around the concept of objects. OOP concepts (OOP) intend to improve code readability and reusability by defining how to structure a Java program efficiently. The main principles of object-oriented programming are:

    1. Abstraction
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism
    5. Association
    6. Aggregation
    7. Composition

Java comes with specific code structures for each OOP principle. For example, the extends keyword for inheritance or getter and setter methods for encapsulation.


# What are OOP concepts in Java?

OOP concepts allow us to create specific interactions between Java objects. They make it possible to reuse code without creating security risks or making a Java program less readable.

Here are the four main principles in more detail.
