 Polymorphism :

     Polymorphism makes it possible to use the same entity in different forms. In Java,
     this means that you can declare several methods with the same name until they are different
     in certain characteristics. Java provides us with two ways to implement polymorphism: method
     overloading and method overriding.

 Static polymorphism :

     Method overloading means that you can have several methods with the same name within a class.
     However, the number, names, or types of their parameters need to be different.

     For example, the Bird() class below has three fly() methods. The first one doesnâ€™t have any parameters,
     the second one has one parameter (height), and the third one has two parameters (name and height).

 **/
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("The bird is flying.");
    }
    public void fly(int height) {
        System.out.println("The bird is flying " + height + " feet high.");
    }
    public void fly(String name, int height) {
        System.out.println("The " + name + " is flying " + height + " feet high.");
    }
}
